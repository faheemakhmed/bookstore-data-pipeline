# Bookstore Data Pipeline (Learning Project)

*A minimal, end-to-end data engineering pipeline for educational purposes*

## IMPORTANT
**This is a SIMPLE PROJECT for learning, NOT production code!**  
Designed to learn core data engineering concepts through a simple, realistic bookstore analytics pipeline. It's intentionally minimal and meant for educational purposes only – not for production use!

Learning Goal: Understand how data moves from source → transformation → database → analytics in 2-3 hours..

##  What You'll Learn
- **ETL Fundamentals**: Extract → Transform → Load patterns
- **Docker Basics**: Containerized environments
- **SQL for Analytics**: Querying data for insights
- **Pipeline Architecture**: How data flows from source to insights

##  Quick Start
1. **Install Docker** (if not already installed)
2. **Clone/download** this project
3. **Run one command**:
   ```bash
   docker-compose up
